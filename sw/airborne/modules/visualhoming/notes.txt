TODO:

- Fix 'ownership' of snapshot structures. They are now allocated by _core, but
  it might be simpler to have them as variables in the module.

- Make settings persistent

- Move homing vector estimation to navigation thread (i.e. run at 10 Hz instead
  of video framerate).

- Guidance. See firmware/rotorcraft/guidance_h, functions _guided_pos and 
  _heading. Target position is in world NED coordinates in m.
  
  Note that the current homing vector estimation is performed on the video
  thread. Use a mutex to safely get the homing vector to the module/navigation
  thread.

- Add telemetry messages.




================================================================================

- See sw/pprz_mutex.h for mutexes. Maar die is dummy als geen ChibiOS. Moet ipv
  daarvan pthread gebruikt worden? Vraag Freek ofzo.

- Use SS_AK, SS_BK in core

- Create simple .py script to generate horizon extraction LUT including image 
  size macros?

- Try to perform own Fourier transform, as the calculation of only the first K 
  frequencies might be faster with a straightforward implementation with sin
  LUT than an FFT?
